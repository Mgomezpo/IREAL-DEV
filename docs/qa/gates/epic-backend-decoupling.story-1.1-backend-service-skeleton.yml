story: docs/stories/epic-backend-decoupling.story-1.1-backend-service-skeleton.md
summary: |
  Story is ready to implement. ACs cover service skeleton, env validation, OpenAPI export,
  and metrics. Only minor note: reference pnpm command when verifying Next build.
risks:
  - name: Dev command mismatch
    mitigation: Update integration verification to use pnpm --filter ireal_demo dev during implementation.
recommendations:
  - Provide .env templates when scaffolding service to help env validation tests.
  - Add CI step asserting OpenAPI artifact is generated.
