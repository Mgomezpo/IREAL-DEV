# 2. Enhancement Scope Definition

## Enhancement Type (checked)
- [x] Integration with New Systems (backend service decoupling)
- [x] Performance/Scalability Improvements (reliability, rate limiting, retries)
- [x] Major Feature Modification (AI integration unification + security)
- [ ] UI/UX Overhaul (incremental UX improvements only)

## Objectives (from brief + repo)
- Decouple backend concerns from the Next.js app via a service layer (NestJS preferred, FastAPI optional for AI pipelines)
- Standardize AI integration (one client lib, consistent response schema, streaming support)
- Meet reliability and security targets (SLOs, rate limiting, retries, secrets handling)
- Provide early UX notes for incomplete front-end areas while keeping MVP focused
